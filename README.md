# adb-interactive-uninstall

Just a quick script to uninstall a lot of packages with an interactive menu from a device.

This was hacked together in less than 4 hours, so there might be bugs that generate data loss.

This script is provided as-is, it's your responsibility to backup your stuff before using this.

With that said, here's how to use it:

1. Install [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and make it available on your PATH
2. Connect your phone and authorize it with ADB (or use [wireless debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#connect-to-a-device-over-wi-fi-android-11+) on Android 11+)
3. Run this script and follow the instructions
